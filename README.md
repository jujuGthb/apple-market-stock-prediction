Time series analysis and prediction for Apple stock prices

# Context

In recent years, the stock market has become increasingly volatile, driven by various factors, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, and technological advancements. As a result, accurately predicting stock price movements has become a challenging yet highly sought-after goal for investors, traders, and financial analysts.

Apple Inc., one of the world's most valuable companies, has consistently been a subject of interest for market participants. Understanding the factors influencing Apple's stock price can provide useful insights into broader market trends and investment opportunities.

This project aims to leverage the power of machine learning and natural language processing to analyze historical stock price data, financial news, and social media sentiment to predict future price movements of Apple stock. By combining advanced statistical techniques with cutting-edge AI algorithms, we aim to develop a robust and accurate prediction model that can assist investors in making informed decisions.

# Objective
To build a simple yet effective model to predict Apple's stock price trends using historical stock data. We will explore basic machine learning techniques like linear regression and time series analysis to understand the underlying patterns and forecast future price movements.

# Project Overview
This dataset workflow outlines the steps involved in collecting, cleaning, and preparing the Apple stock price dataset for machine learning analysis. The process involves the following stages:
**1. Data collection:**
   
##  Challenge:

Scraping historical stock price data from websites can be challenging due to dynamic content and security measures.

## Solution:

To overcome this challenge, we opted to leverage the official Yahoo Finance API. This API provides a reliable and efficient way to access historical stock price data.

## Process: 
**Library Installation:**

We installed the finance library using the command: !pip install --upgrade finance.
**Data Retrieval:**

Utilizing the finance library, we retrieved historical Apple stock price data directly from the Yahoo Finance API.
**Data Conversion:**

The downloaded data was converted to a CSV format for further analysis using the command: data.to_csv('AAPL_stock_data.csv')
**Data Range:**

We fetched data from 2004 to 2023, resulting in a dataset with 5033 records.
This approach ensured a clean and reliable data source for our project.

**2.  Data Processing:**

The dataset was loaded from the 'AAPL_stock_data.csv' file, with the 'Date' column set as the index. Missing values, if any, were handled using forward filling to maintain data continuity. To improve model performance and ensure fair comparisons, the data was standardized using a StandardScaler. Outliers, identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, were removed to prevent their undue influence on the model.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

To gain insights into the data and inform feature engineering, an exploratory data analysis was conducted. A correlation matrix was generated to visualize the relationships between different features. A rolling volatility calculation was performed to understand the stock's price volatility over time. These analyses helped identify potential trends, seasonality, and other relevant patterns.
